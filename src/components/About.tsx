          Hi, I’m Rana Kaya! Born and raised in Lommel, Belgium, I’ve had a
          lifelong passion for creativity and design. Crafting and exploring new
          ideas have always been my favorite activities. When I’m not designing,
          I love spending time with family and friends, who inspire me every
          day. I’m excited to turn my passion into something meaningful!
